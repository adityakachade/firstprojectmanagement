Using GitHub's project management features—milestones, issues, and project boards—can significantly enhance team collaboration and project organization. Milestones allow teams to break down the project into clear, achievable goals with defined timelines. By setting specific dates and assigning tasks, everyone on the team can understand the project's overall progress and what needs to be accomplished by when. This fosters accountability and ensures that deadlines are met.
